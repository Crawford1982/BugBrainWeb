            <p>By using BugBrain tools, you agree to play fair and not be a jerk. Legally speaking, here's the gist:</p>

                    <strong>Use at Your Own Risk</strong><br>
                    Our tools are provided "as is." We test thoroughly, but can't guarantee that every bug, false positive, or server hiccup is avoided. You're responsible for how you use them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>No Illegal Scanning</strong><br>
                    You agree not to scan anything you don't have permission to test. Seriously. Respect laws and platform terms. We don't endorse or tolerate illegal hacking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Your Data</strong><br>
                    We don't claim ownership over your input. We just process it for the tool to work. If you're on Pro and choose to save history, we store that securely until you delete it.
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Pro Features</strong><br>
                    If you upgrade to a paid plan, you agree not to share access or abuse limits. We reserve the right to suspend misuse â€” but we'll reach out like decent humans first.
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Bugs Happen</strong><br>
                    If something breaks, we'll try to fix it fast. But we're not liable for any damages, losses, or intergalactic mishaps caused by our software.
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Changes</strong><br>
                    We may tweak these terms. If it's a big change, we'll let you know. Continued use means you're cool with it.
                </li>
